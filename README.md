Assignments for [Berkeley CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/). fa22 version

Original homework repo: https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework_fall2022

I didn't choose the latest fa23 version for:

1. Lack of reference. And the material in the origin repo is also incomplete.
2. Google cloud supporting in hw2 needs foreign currency credit card, which is a little hard to reach for college students.
3. Not fit the video course of fa19 version.

When complete the homework, I heavily refer these repo, thank you!

https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/cs285-homework  Though not the same version, very good reference!

https://github.com/bri25yu/rl  somewhat buggy implementation, but the overall coding, running and graph creating scripts are extraordinary references!
